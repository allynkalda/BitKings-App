Do not risk more than what you are allowed to lose as cryptocurrency trading is considered as high risk. Also, for big orders, check the available liquidity in the pairs you are going to trade (orderbooks size) using the Pro Trading Screen in order to avoid quite big slippages. Limit orders are recommended for big trades.</p>`
